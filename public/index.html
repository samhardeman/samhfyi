    hey my name is sam and welcome to my humble site.
why? knowledge is less useful when it is not shared. i began taking more notes about my projects after i was setting up hyprland on a new linux installation and wanted to save how i did things so i could come back later and fix problems if i were to have any. less selfishly, i wanted to have the notes so that i could help other people, if they encounter issues similar to the ones i encountered.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/test-post/">Test Post</a></h2>
    Ok enough with the vulgarities, I think the new styles look better, don&rsquo;t you?
