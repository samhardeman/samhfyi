hey my name is sam and welcome to my humble site.

### why does this exist?

knowledge is less useful when it is not shared. i began taking more notes about my projects after i was setting up hyprland on a new linux installation and wanted to save how i did things so i could come back later and fix problems if i were to have any. less selfishly, i wanted to have the notes so that i could help other people, if they encounter issues similar to the ones i encountered. to maximize this goal, i want to put some of those notes here - project related or not. to increase knowledge, improve my writing, and share some of my ideas. 

thanks for reading,

sam

### design

it's minimalist by design, i want it to be as fast and accessible as possible
