1. The reformed have a very serious view of sin. Reformed Christians believe that we are spiritually dead in our transgressions and sins. Not sick or wounded with the potential capacity to heal ourselves. Because we are spiritually dead we are alienated from God. By nature, enemies of God. Deep a sober sense of the human predicament.
2. Worship is first and foremost about God, not about me and how I can be joyful or express my emotions to God. God must be at the center of our worship. Regulative principle of worship wants scripture to regulate worship. God wants his word to be read and preached, prayers prayed, songs sung, and people to be baptized. Simple worship. Dialogical principle of worship. Worship is a dialogue between God and his people. Meeting of God with his people. Worship is the whole service. Reading and preaching are central. The sacraments are God's gift to his church. Fellowship and communion with Christ through the Lord's Supper.
3. The Church is really important and cannot be separated from Christianity. It is a necessity not an option. There are no other ways to be Christians apart from the church. Canons of Dort, Belgic and Heidelberg Confession.
4. God has always had a people for himself. The ecclesia in the wilderness. God calls people to himself. There is one people of God, the church goes back to the Creation of Man. All of scripture is a relevant for us, all of it proclaims Jesus Christ. God has entered into covenants with people throughout history and this is how we understand history and scripture. Covenental view.
5. Be actively engaged in the broader culture. Not just evangelizing but doing a variety of things, producing art, participating in politics, science, business. Honor God and bless neighbors. Instruments of God taking care of the world. The things of the world are not the final things. They will pass away. We will be in everlasting fellowship with God. We cannot be consumed by the things of the world.
